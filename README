This is a Mentee Network implementation done using theano

Requirements:
Python Libraries
thenao 0.1 
numpy

Dataset:
Taken from http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Public/DeepVsShallowComparisonICML2007
Made into theano/project ready format made availabe at: 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/93u6xsrew0ec7cw/AACIYVQ13yEmaK-311zqxzx7a?dl=0
The files should be saved in the data folder 
The name of the dataset files are:
MNIST basic 	- mnist.pkl.gz
MNIST + background images -	backgroundVarImg.pkl.gz
MNIST + random background - backgroundRanImg.pkl.gz	
Rotated MNIST digits - rotateImg.pkl.gz


Steps to run Mentor:
run the theanoMlP.py to run the mentor network.
At the end of the run best_model_mlp_params.pkl is created which stores the parameters learned by mentor
Data variations can be tried out by editing the dataset file name in main function

Steps to run the mentee:
run the mentee.py to run the mentor network.
We have provided the MNIST datasets learned parameter, so directly running the mentee file will work
Plots for the run are displayed at the end and are saved in the plots folder
Data variations can be tried out by editing the dataset file name in main function
